- css

  - grid
  - Better to use a grid, if the layout is two dimensional
  - @media screen and (min-width: 992px)
  - --same-- (min-width) (max-width)--same--
  - --same-- rwd-> <-rwd --same--
  - scroll

    ```
        <!-- link -->
        <a href="#services"> services </a>
        <!-- element -->
        <section id="services"></section>

        html {
        scroll-behavior: smooth;
        }
        .section {
        /* navbar height */
        scroll-margin-top: 4rem;
        }
    ```

    - design

      - the outer scope does not define margin
      - the inner scope may be define
        ```
        .section-center {
            width: 90vw;
            margin: 0 auto;
            max-width: 1170px;
            }
        ```
      - if respoonsice, combine with above by adding another class

        ```
        @media screen and (min-width: 992px) {
        .about-center {
            display: grid;
            grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
            column-gap: 2rem;
        }
        }
        ```

- react
  - App.jsx is the root component
  - The component.css will replace index.css
  - Great thinking: Define data, iterate it and render by component using map. For future updating, we just need to update the component code (since html is hard-coding, no template exists)
  - the data above can be whatever you thought. e.g. link, title, subtitle, text, icon ...
  - datas can be loaded in the scope of components not global (PageLinks.jsx)
