  - Destructuring only specific keys
  - ()=> xxx is equivalent to ()=>{return xxx}
  - if jsx return contains multiple line then paranthesis is needed
  - Side Effects: Think of side effects as anything extra that React doesnâ€™t manage by default!
  - Side effects trigger changes in state or props, and React responds to those changes by re-rendering.
  - That's why side effects are kept separate and managed with tools like useEffect
