- Subarray with specific properties (Sliding Window, Prefix Sum)
  - First, think of a brute force template
    ```
    for r in range(len(nums)):
      #itself
      for l in range(0,r):
        # Check subarray properties here
      # consider current nums[r]
      ...
    ```
  - Second, think of data structure(hashmap,variable) or algorithm (sliding window) to reduce the time complexity
  - Notes: Subarray Sum Equals seems not suitable for sliding window since it includes negative interger
  - Notes: hashmap is useful in iterative methods when you need to keep track of previous record as key
  - Notes: The key of the hashmap should be chosen based on the problem requirements (e.g., prefix sums, frequency counts).
