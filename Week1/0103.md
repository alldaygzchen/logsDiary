- Subarray with specific properties (Sliding Window, Prefix Sum)
  - First, think of a brute force template
    ```
    for r in range(len(nums)):
        for l in range(0,r):
        # Check subarray properties here
            ...
    ```
  - Second, is the problem suitable for sliding window (e.g. Subarray Sum Equals seems not since it includes negative interger)
  - Third, think of method to reduce for loop such as hashmap
  - Notes: hashmap is useful in iterative methods when you need to keep track of previous record as key
  - Notes: The key of the hashmap should be chosen based on the problem requirements (e.g., prefix sums, frequency counts).
